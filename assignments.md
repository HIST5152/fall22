# Class preparation assignments

## Readings + Annotations
Readings are assigned weekly and should be completed before each class. We won’t have an extensive discussion of the assigned material during class time; instead, the class will work to collaboratively annotate the readings using the Hypothes.is tool. We will discuss more about Hypothes.is on the first week of class. Readings and annotations will help you prepare for class, understand the stakes and possibilities of various methods and tools in digital scholarship, and deeply engage in dialogues with your classmates.

### Guidelines
Each week, you will review a variety of materials that may differ from what you are accustomed to encountering in a graduate-level history course. The assigned materials reflect an assortment of formats and genres including case studies, process documents, “grey literature,” artistic creations, recorded talks, blog entries, and formal or informal discussions of methods and/or tools. In addition, the creators of these works will come from an array of disciplinary and professional backgrounds which may be unfamiliar to you.

In reviewing these items, I ask that you:
: - Consider the context in which the material was published or presented. An article from the International Journal of Communication, for example, may not (and should not be expected to) answer all of your historiographical questions.
: - Recognize that it’s easy to levy criticism, undirected outrage, and sactimonious dismissal toward projects, problems, and strawmen. Proposing or pointing to concrete solutions is a much more constructive tactic and will serve you more fruitfully in your professional pursuits.
: - Reflect consistently on how you can augment the material’s content and add to an open-minded, solution-oriented group conversation.

### Grading criteria
Aim for five (5) or more “substantial” annotations per piece - thoughtful contributions that productively move the conversation forward. [Hypothes.is also has some tips for better annotations here](https://web.hypothes.is/annotation-tips-for-students/)

## Leading discussion
Each student in the course will lead discussion during one week of the class. On this week you will be responsible for posing questions in the readings annotations and keeping the conversation going. You'll give a brief summary on the discussion at the start of class.
