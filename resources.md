# Tech Help + Troubleshooting 🔌 {#tech}
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You'll be introduced to a lot of tools and methodologies in this course which you may not have any experience with. A major portion of the class is devoted to becoming more familiar and comfortable with technical problem-solving tasks, many of which will involve the use of computers and digital technology. It is <strong>vital </strong>for you to know that you're going to encounter situations where something doesn't work the way it is supposed to. In those cases, it's your job to determine what the problem is, how you might attempt to fix it, and how you'll approach others for their assistance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It will be frustrating, but it will be worth it, because when you leave this course, you'll take with you the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>A recognition of <strong>iteration, experimentation, and “failure”</strong> as an important, inherent part of the process of learning, making, and doing things that are worthwhile.</li><li>Strategies for <strong>creating, evaluating, and analyzing</strong> multimodal projects.</li><li>CV-ready, <strong>hands-on experience</strong> integrating the methods and tools of digital humanities into the advancement of research interests, scholarship, and professional goals.</li></ul>

That means that while I will do everything in my power to provide support and guidance, I cannot promise to keep a disclosure of that nature strictly confidential.</p>
