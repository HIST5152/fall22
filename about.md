### Course Description

The use of digital methods to enhance and streamline the study, interpretation, and presentation of historical topics (the so-called “digital turn”) has gained a good bit of traction within the discipline in the recent past. This class will explore digital history methodologies, tools, and practices including digital mapping, data visualization, textual and social network analysis, interactive exhibitions, augmented and virtual reality, digital editions/publications, podcasts and oral history, the incorporation of digital pedagogy in the classroom, and more. In addition to gaining familiarity with various tools and technologies, students will discuss major issues in the field, including questions of narrative, audience, shared authority, ethics, accessibility, preservation, data integrity, and other considerations pertinent to the historical method. This course is eligible for credit toward the Graduate Certificate in Cultural Analytics.

### Course goals include:

- Examine evolving theory and major debates within digital humanities and digital history, including issues of transparency, ethics, accessibility, authority, and legitimacy.
- Discover how to use digital projects to engage with multiple stakeholders and audiences and encourage conversations and collaborations
- Evaluate and critically assess digital methodologies and tools through hands-on technical experimentation and skillbuilding
- Determine how methods of digital history might contribute to the advancement of research interests, scholarship, and professional goals

### Key Questions:
- What is digital history? How do methods of the so-called digital turn intersect with the work of doing history?
- What are some of the pros and cons of using digital tools in the production of historical scholarship? 
- How can I do cool things with digital tools and resources? Who else in the field is currently doing cool things? 
- Where can I go for help if I have questions or need guidance, instructions, or inspiration for my projects? How do I keep updated on developments in the field?

All course materials are available free-of-cost online, or otherwise will be provided to students by the instructor.
